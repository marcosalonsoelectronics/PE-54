Material for video PE-54: High-Power-Factor Off-line LED Driver based on Flyback Converter

This video shows the analysis and design of a high-power-factor off-line LED driver based on flyback converter. The flyback converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode to achieve high power factor. LTspice simulations are shown to verify the design.
